# RISKMANAGEMENTAPI
The new, highly volatile market order that has prevailed in recent years, coupled with recent regulatory changes
, is increasing the pressure on asset managers to propose an asset allocation that exactly matches their clients' image.
The client has questioned the ability of the proposed investment strategy to generate returns while maintaining wealth. 
Institutions must be able to engage clients in understanding risk factors and demonstrate clear and transparent risk mitigation processes to gain client trust. 
In a competitive world, every company seeks to increase its market share through innovation. 
In order to fill the gap in its risk management solution, KYRIA has initiated a project that will evaluate the performance of a portfolio, build a model portfolio taking into account the existing literature on asset allocation issues and propose an integrated high frequency trading system. 
To assist KYRIA in the development of this project, we have built an api using plumber package
